# Node.js Application
This repository contains a simple Node.js application that provides a REST API for managing data. The application is deployed using a Jenkins pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Jenkins Pipeline
The Jenkins pipeline automates the build, testing, and deployment of the Node.js application. The pipeline consists of the following stages:

- Build: This stage builds the Docker image for the application.
- Test: This stage runs unit tests for the application.
- Deploy: This stage deploys the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Dockerfile
The Dockerfile defines the instructions for building the Docker image for the Node.js application. The image includes the application code, dependencies, and runtime environment.

The Dockerfile starts with the base image for the Node.js application, installs the application dependencies, and copies the application code into the image. The image is then built and tagged for deployment.

## Kubernetes YAML
The Kubernetes YAML defines the deployment and service for the Node.js application in a Kubernetes cluster. The deployment defines how many replicas of the application to run, the container image to use, and the resource requests and limits for the application.

The service defines how the application is exposed to the outside world. In this case, the service uses a LoadBalancer to expose the application on a public IP address.

## Running the Application
To run the application, you will need to have Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes installed.

- Set up a Jenkins server and connect it to your Git repository.
- Create a Jenkins pipeline job that uses the Jenkinsfile in this repository.
- Build the Docker image for the application by running the following command:

`docker build -t my-node-app .`
- Deploy the Docker image to your Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:

`kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`

- Access the application in your browser by visiting the following URL:

`http://<external-ip>:3000/data`

Where `external-ip` is the external IP address of your Kubernetes cluster.

The application provides the following endpoints:

`GET /data`: Retrieves data from the application.

`POST /data`: Creates new data in the application.

`PUT /data/:id`: Updates existing data in the application.

`DELETE /data/:id`: Deletes existing data from the application.

## Troubleshooting
If you have any problems running the application, please check the following:
- Make sure that Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes are installed and running correctly.
- Make sure that the Jenkins pipeline is configured correctly.
- Make sure that the Docker image is built and pushed to your Docker registry.
- Make sure that the Kubernetes deployment and service are configured correctly.
  
You can also check the logs for the application, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes to see if there are any errors.
